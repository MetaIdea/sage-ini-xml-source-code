Unofficial C&C4 Patch 1.04 -- by Zocom7

Installation: just replace the Maps.big in the C&C4 Data directory. Make sure you back up the original maps.big file.

Because C&C4 isn't moddable yet, only the maps are modified. Although created and credited by EA, all of the maps had to be modified for greater CP value, which means build and put more units onto the battlefield.

Changes in this first release:
1) First 3 tutorial missions (which is GDI) have their CP doubled.
2) Next 4 GDI missions (after tutorials) have their CP to 200. Last 3 GDI missions have their CP to 300. The 2nd player has the CP set to 100.
3) First 4 NOD missions have thier CP to 200. Last 3 NOD missions (including the bonus mission) have their CP set to 300.
4) All official skirmish and MP maps have their CP set to 300 for human players only. I probably would make it more interesting in the future that even AI players will have their CP set to 300 as well.
5) A few official SP/MP maps that were not finished by developers have been finished.

To confirm, there are 18 SP mission maps, 15 official skirmish/MP maps, a small amount of test maps related to already created official SP and MP maps, and 17 skirmish/MP were actually incomplete and not-ready for skirmish play.

On the second release of the unofficial C&C4 Patch 1.04, I'll be releasing 17 other skirmish/MP maps that were incomplete by developers due to the development rush (because of that EALA shutdown). Those will be edited for playing with given names.

So that's it then, Zocom7 out.
