; FILE: GoodFactionUnits.ini ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////
; This file contains only objects that are units tied to GOOD factions.
; You will find tanks, infantry, transports ... all our "units" here.  
;//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
;The new ThingClass names are:
;  "UNSPECIFIED",
; "HORDE_UNIT",
; "CHARACTER_UNIT",
; "CAVALRY_UNIT",
; "MEDIUM_MONSTER",
; "LARGE_MONSTER",
; "PROP",
; "CIV_BUILDING",
; "WALL_PIECE",
; "FACTION_BUILDING",
; "LANDMARK_BUILDING",
; "GROUND_COVER",
; "BUSH",
; "TREE",

; Objects will have the first word of their name be their Faction.  Rohan, Gondor,
; Isengard, and Mordor.  Please sort them in this file in that way as well.  The rest of their
; name will try to be generic since the detail can change, but the heroes can have
; their true name since they won't change.  Generic names are important because the 
; game name could change, and not everyone knows what a Rohirim is.  All four sides
; have a Worker, Fighter, Archer, and Cavalry.

; Please maintain the BALANCE keyword.  Put a ; BALANCE Name on the Object definition
; line to show what to search on, and then put ; BALANCE Name Keyword on every line
; that Design would be most likely to need to find quickly.  Suggestions include
; Health, Damage, Weapon, etc, but the most important part would be to get the Object
; definition line, because then they could search and find all weywords.
