; Syntax:
; CrowdResponse <Name>
;	 Threshold <Count>
;		VoiceSelect = <Sound>
;       VoiceMove = <Sound>
;       [etc for any & all voices]
;       UnitSpecificSounds
;           VoiceGarrison = <Sound>
;		    [etc for any & all voices]

;    Weight = ##
; End
;
; This describes the extra sounds made by a group of units when they are all selected and told to do something.
; Besides the main voice played by one of the units, the CrowdResponseSystem adds some extra sounds based on
; the units being selected. 
; Basically, if you select a group of units, all of which have the line "CrowdResponseKey = <Name>" in their
; definitions, then the CrowdResponseSystem (CRS) will count the number of units, find the Threshold entry
; with the largest count <= the number of units, and play the sound given by VoiceSelect under that
; Threshold.
; The Weight is used with mixed groups. CRS will only play one sound per event, normally the one referenced
; by the most units. But this count is multiplied by the weight (default 100), so that if a 
; CrowdResponse has a Weight of 200, it will get to play when only 1/3 + 1 of the units use that CrowdResponse.
; (1/3 * 200 >= 2/3 * 100)
