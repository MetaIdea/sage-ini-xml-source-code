		StructureSeconds:			Try to build a structure every N seconds.
		TeamSeconds:				Try to build a team every N seconds.
		ResourcesWealthy:			How many resources to be wealthy.
		ResourcesPoor:				How few resources to be poor.
		StructuresWealthyMod:		Factor to multiply m_structurFrames by if we are wealthy.
		TeamWealthyMod:				Factor to multiply m_teamFrames by if we are wealthy.
		StructuresPoorMod:			Factor to multiply m_structureFrames by if we are poor.
		TeamPoorMod:				Factor to multiply m_teamFrames if we are poor.
		TeamResourcesToBuild:		Amount of the resources needed to build a team required before we start.
		GuardChaseUnitFrames:		Number of frames for which a guarding unit will chase attackers before giving up
		GuardEnemyScanRate:			Rate to scan for enemies while guarding
		GuardEnemyReturnScanRate:	Rate to scan for enemies while guarding but returning
		WallHeight:					Height of special wall units can walk on top of
		SkirmishGroupFudgeValue:	How close to a waypoint does a group of units have to be to consider itself at the waypoint?
									SkirmishGroupFudgeValue is multiplied by the number of the units in the group asking if its
									close enough to determine this.		
									So for instance (if SkirmishGroupFudgeValue was 5), if 2 units are walking along a path, 
									they would check to see if they were less than 10 feet away from the waypoint in order 
									to say they were close enough. A group of 10 units would consider themselves close enough 
									if they were within 50 feet of the waypoint.

		MaxRecruitDistance:			Maximum distance away that units can be recruited.
		RepulsedDistance:			How far a repulsed unit will run past vision range before stopping.
		EnableRepulsors:			Is repulsion enabled?

		ForceSkirmishAI:			If true, forces skirmish ai instead of solo ai for development until the skirmish ui is done.
		RotateSkirmishBases:		If true, rotates skirmish ai bases to face the center of the map.
		AttackUsesLineOfSight:		If true, attack for units with KINDOF_ATTACK_NEEDS_LINE_OF_SIGHT  uses line of sight.
		MinDistanceForGroup:		We need to move at least this far to do it.
		FormationEnemyDistance:		Has to be this far from enemies to use formations. 
		RebuildDelaySeconds: 		Seconds to delay rebuilding after a base building is destroyed or captured.
		SupplyCenterSafeRadius: 	Radius to scan for enemies to determine safety.
		AIDozerBoredRadiusModifier: Modifies ai dozers scan range so the move out farther than human ones.
		AICrushesInfantry:			If true, AI vehicles will attempt to crush infantry.
		MeleeApproachTolerance:		Melee units inside this radius will engage their targets.
		MeleeApproachDist:			Melee units will approach to this distance.
		WadeWaterDepth:				Depth units can wade into the water, or cross at a ford. 
		DeepWaterDepth:				Depth units like battleships require, so the water is deep rather than shallow.
		FormationColumnWidth:		Left to right spacing between formation columns.
		FormationRowDepth:			Front to back spacing between formation rows.
		FormationSquadSpacing:		Extra spacing between squads.
		NarrowPassageScale:			How much to tighten formations in narrow areas.
		M_maxSquadWidth:			How many hordes across do we make formations.
		WaitForOthers:				Wait for the formation to form up at the first waypoint.
		HordesWaitForHordes:		When moving, hordes will wait (or not) for other hordes and units to pass.
		AttackMoveUsesFormations:	When the player attack moves, the units move in formation.
		AllowForestFires:			Allow trees to burn.
		UseFormations:				Allow units to move in formation.  May be turned off for twisty maps like moria.
		Optimization_NumTeamsToRecruit:  How many teams can a skirmish ai try to recruit in 1 frame? Included to prevent spikes in framerate
		Optimization_TimeToCacheCanEnterTransport: During team recruiting, once we've figured out if a unit can enter a transport, how long do we cache that information before recomputing?
		Optimization_TimeToCacheCanReachMobileTarget: During team recrutiting, once we've figured out if a unit can reach a mobile target, how long do we (usually) cache that information before recomputing?
		Optimization_TimeToCacheCanReachImmobileTarget: During team recrutiting, once we've figured out if a unit can reach a immobile target, how long do we (usually) cache that information before recomputing?
