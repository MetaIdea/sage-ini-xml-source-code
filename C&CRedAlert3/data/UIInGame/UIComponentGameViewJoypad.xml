<!--
* RightStickMultiplier
	This affects the speed of camera rotation.

* KindOfExemptFromAttraction
	List the kind of types that we don't want the cursor "magnetically" attracted to.
		
* MinAttractDistance
	The distance in screen pixels where we start feeling the force of attraction when fully zoomed out.
	This value is multiplied by the MagnetismTuning_XXX_Distance value (where XX is either LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH).
	
* MinAttractDistanceZoomed
	The distance in screen pixels where we start feeling the force of attraction when fully zoomed in.
	This value is multiplied by the MagnetismTuning_XXX_Distance value (where XX is either LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH).

* MaxAttractiveForce - unknown units
	The maximum strength of the "magnetic" attraction between the reticle and its nearest on-screen unit.
	This value is multiplied by the MagnetismTuning_XXX_Strength value (where XX is either LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH).
  
* ScrollSpeedMin - Unknown units
	This affects the minimum scrolling speed of the camera/reticle when the right trigger is NOT pulled.

* ScrollSpeedMax - Unknown units
	This affects the maximum scrolling speed of the camera/reticle when the right trigger is NOT pulled.

* ScrollSpeedMinCutoff
	Minimum stick deflection required to initiate scrolling at ScrollSpeedMin.
	0.0 = no deflection; 1.0 = full deflection
  
* ScrollSpeedMaxCutoff
	Maximum stick deflection before the scrolling speed is clamped at ScrollSpeedMax.
	0.0 = no deflection; 1.0 = full deflection

* MagnetismTuning_LOW_Strength
	When the player's preferences are set to use "Low" magnetism, this value is multiplied
	by the computed force between the reticle and the nearest unit. MEDIUM is equal to 1.0.

* MagnetismTuning_HIGH_Strength
	When the player's preferences are set to use "High" magnetism, this value is multiplied
	by the computed force between the reticle and the nearest unit. MEDIUM is equal to 1.0.

* MagnetismTuning_LOW_Distance
	When the player's preferences are set to use "Low" magnetism, this value is multiplied
	by the attraction distance. MEDIUM is equal to 1.0, so this value should be less than one.

* MagnetismTuning_HIGH_Distance
	When the player's preferences are set to use "High" magnetism, this value is multiplied
	by the attraction distance. MEDIUM is equal to 1.0, so this value should be greater than one.
