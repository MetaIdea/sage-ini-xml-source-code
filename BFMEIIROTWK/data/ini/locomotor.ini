;Locomotors are now speed independent and contain percentages for their movement. 
;This allows for designers to specify one value (a base speed) that affects the locomotor's turning rate, acceleration, lift, etc.
;The base speed is now specified in a LocomotorSet definition for a Thing. Here is the new syntax to specify a locomotor for a Thing:
;	LocomotorSet
;		Condition	= SET_NORMAL
;		Locomotor	= SomeLocomotor
;		Speed		= 45
;	End
;A Locomotor now uses percentages, instead of speed values to specify movement.
;Here is what a locomotor looks like now:
;	Locomotor HumanLocomotor
;		Surfaces		= GROUND RUBBLE
;		TurnTime              = 500
;		TurnTimeDamaged      = 500
;		Acceleration    = 200%
;		AccelerationDamaged   = 100%
;		Braking               = 200%
;		MinTurnSpeed          = 0%
;		ZAxisBehavior         = NO_Z_MOTIVE_FORCE
;		Appearance            = TWO_LEGS
;		StickToGround         = Yes       ; walking guys aren't allowed to catch huge (or even small) air.
;	End
;
;If you have to create a new locomotor, the best bet is to find one that is similar to what you want, copy it and
;modify the areas that need to be changed.
