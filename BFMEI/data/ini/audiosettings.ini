  MixaheadLatency = 112				  ; Time, in milliseconds, that Miles should "mix ahead"

									  ; especially noticable for Windows 98 & Me.
									  ; However, this also adds to the time that the audio system
									  ; takes to react to any requests. E.g. if this is 6000, then
									  ; it will take 6 seconds between the time a unit starts moving
									  ; and the time its move loop starts playing. 
									  ; Number should be divisible by 8.
									  ; The Miles default is 64. Setting it lower is NOT recommended.
									  ; We may want to consider setting it slightly higher, though.
									  ; In particular, we may want to consider setting this higher for
									  ; low-end machines (esp 98 + Me) which are more likely to starve

  MixaheadLatencyDuringMovies = 448   ; Mix ahead while full screen movies are playing. Higher because

  3DBufferLengthMS = 557              ; To work correctly with hardware providers, we need to put 3D looped

									  ; This is the size of that buffer, in MS. If this number is too small,
									  ; we risk having repeated sound fragments (if the read pointer loops 
									  ; all the way round before we fill the buffer any more). Making this
									  ; number too large will waste memory, plus it will make such sounds
									  ; less responsive to stop requests. 
									  ; Actually, there's no point in making this below 557 MS. The code
									  ; internally will force all buffers to be at least 48K, because 
									  ; Miles copies data in in 16K chunks. So setting this smaller won't
									  ; make your buffers any smaller. (557 MS = 48K divided by the data
									  ; rate of a 44.1K, 16 bit sound)
									  ; Note that file read of the next .wav file takes place during this
									  ; time, so 1/2 of the buffer duration needs to be enough time to read a 
									  ; wav off of disk, decompress it (if needed), and shove it into
									  ; the buffer.

										    ; but it will increase the CPU usage.
