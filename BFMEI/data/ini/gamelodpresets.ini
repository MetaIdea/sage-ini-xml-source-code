; If CPU speed is below this, audio prefers the low-CPU setting.

;Each of these presets specifies the minimum hardware required to get the setting.
;The highest setting that passes all hardware requirements is chosen as the default.
;We do not need to list every possible combination because they will automatically
;find the closest match.  LOW is the default so we really only need to list the
;configs that result in MEDIUM or HIGH.
