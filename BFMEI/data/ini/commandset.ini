; CommandSet.ini
;
; See what was for Generals below.  For LotR things have changed since we no longer have
; the same UI.
; If the Command in CommandButton.ini has a field Radial=Yes, then that command
; will show up in a radial menu above the object in the game world.
;
; If a command button has InPalantir=Yes then it will be displayed in the
; palantir when it's in a command set for the selected object.
;
; Locations for the Skill button in clockwise fashion.  The top right button
; being button 1. 

; If these actions are not taken, the commands will only show
; up if you pass in -OldGui to the game (but they are not usable right now)
; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;Command sets are groups of command buttons that will be displayed in the
;context sensitive user interface for a selected object showing what you
;can do with that object
;
;LHS numbers are the physical GUI buttons.  You can assign a command
;to any of the physical buttons, they do *NOT* need to appear in
;continuous order ... you may have gaps if you desire
;
;RHS strings are CommandButton.ini command names
;
;Buttons for a regular command context are ordered as:
;                    +--+
;+--+--+--+--+--+--+ |13|
;|01|03|05|07|09|11| +--+
;+--+--+--+--+--+--+ |14|    <-- Smaller buttons 3 fit within 11 & 12 in height.
;|02|04|06|08|10|12| +--+
;+--+--+--+--+--+--+ |15|
;                    +--+
;------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Many things just want these three buttons.
