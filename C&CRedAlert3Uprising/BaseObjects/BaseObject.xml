	This is the BaseObject.  This object is meant for specifying modules which
	_must_ be present on _every_ object in the game.  Every object in the game
	_must_ inherit from this.  Do _not_ specify anything even slightly less
	than universal here.
	
	As of 6/5/07, this is the list of objects which do NOT inherit from here,
	because they are "props" and have specialized optimizations.  These include
	but are not limited to:
		BaseTree
		BaseTopple
		BaseRockBig
		BaseRock
		BaseOptimizedProp
		BaseDebris
		Audio objects (Ambient Audio)
